# 430 Course Delivery Notes

## I. Overview

- For the rest of the semester, to give you all maximum flexibility as to when to access course lectures, all course content will be delivered asynchronously via pre-recorded videos and HW assignments
- Lectures​ will remain much the same as they were during our in-person meetings. I will record myself going through the demos, explaining things as I go. These videos will be posted to the *MyCourses *Videos & Links (post break)* content section on a weekly basis
- This format is beneficial to those of you who are living in other time zones, lacking high-speed connectivity, or having to share a personal computer or quiet space with other household members during normal working hours.
- Other than an occasional "all hands" meeting during our originally scheduled class meeting time, we are NOT using a synchronous approach where all the students are required to meet online at the same time.


## II. Getting Help
- I will be active on Discord and Email as often as I can to answer questions that come up. If you are not currently in the discord, I HIGHLY recommend joining: ​https://discord.gg/BArWmBR
- Office Hours
  - Week 10 (Thursday 3/26) - will be on 430 Discord channel during regularly scheduled classtime
  - Week 11 (Tuesday 3/31 & Thursday 4/2) - will be on 430 Discord channel during regularly scheduled classtime

## III. Homework Assignments
 - will remain mostly unchanged other than that they have been pushed back to account for the missing week of classes
 - much of the optional content of the course has been pruned so that you can focus on the final project
 - I do understand that with 2 weeks off, some of you might be feeling a little "rusty", so I created two very simple HW assignments that are due soon - **Mongo HW** & **Express/Handlebars HW**, both with accompanying videos - see the Assignments section of myCourses):
   - these are designed as a "reality check" on your current ability (based on these unforeseen circumstances) to do work remotely for this course
   - recall that under the course rubric, homework is 50% of your final 430 grade, and the completion of HW assignments is also essential to your preparation for the final project
   - if you are unable to complete these 2 assignments in a timely manner, you must immediately contact me to discuss your options regarding continuing in this course
   
## IV. Handing work in late
 - Your completion of the remaining assignments is crucial to your successful completion of the final project. I strongly recommend that you WORK AHEAD on all assignments and complete them well in advance of the due date
    - If you have time conflict, get sick, have unforeseen responsibilities, and so on, you can get an extension, but you need to:
        - 1) notify your professor of your situation *in advance* of the due date
        - 2) propose and commit to a day & time when the work will be completed
        - 3) your professor will then notify you of a revised due date (which may or may not be the same date that you proposed), and they will then add an *exception* to the dropbox that reflects the new due date
        - 4) complete and submit the work prior to the expiration of your dropbox exception
 
## V. The Final Project
- Projects 2 and 3 will now be combined into a single, larger project Given the time constraints we now face, it is unreasonable to ask everyone to do two complete projects. 
- Instead, you will complete one "Final Project" that is slightly larger than either of the two. This project will be worth 40% of your grade (Project 2 was worth 15% and Project 3 was worth 25%), and a portion of that grade will be your completion of the "Milestone"
- Project details are listed on the course website:
  - https://people.rit.edu/arwigm/430/
  - what is this project about? You will be expected to create a Product/Service using MV* and React
  - I am no longer allowing groups for this project

## VI. Questions & Concerns
- I believe the above to be the best way to maintain the level of education that you deserve and will need for your careers while doing everything I can to not overload people. I know there is a lot of anxiety right now, and even with the reduction from two projects to one, things could still feel difficult if you are uncomfortable with the topics. Know that I am aware of this, and it will be factored into my grading of that project. 
- **Important -->** be sure to fill out the *"How are we all working: technology, Internet and space??"* survey in myCourses:
  - it closes 11:59PM tonight (3/24/20) 
  - if you do not fill it out, I will be emailing you tomorrow and sending an alert through Starfish (advising)
- What questions do you have? What else do I need to address?
