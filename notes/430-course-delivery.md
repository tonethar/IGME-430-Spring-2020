# 430 Course Delivery

## I. Overview

- For the rest of the semester, to give you all maximum flexibility as to when to access course lectures, all course content will be delivered asynchronously via pre-recorded videos and HW assignments
- Lectures​ will remain much the same as they were during our in-person meetings. I will record myself going through the demos, explaining things as I go. These videos will be posted to the *MyCourses *Videos & Links (post break)* content section on a weekly basis
- This format is beneficial to those of you who are living in other time zones, lacking high-speed connectivity, or having to share a personal computer or quiet space with other household members during normal working hours.
- Other than an occasional "all hands" meeting during our originally scheduled class meeting time, we are NOT using a synchronous approach where all the students are required to meet online at the same time.


## II. Getting Help
- I will be active on Discord and Email as often as I can to answer questions that come up. If you are not currently in the discord, I HIGHLY recommend joining: ​https://discord.gg/BArWmBR
- Office Hours
  - Week 10 (Thursday 3/26) - will be on 430 Discord channel during regularly scheduled classtime
  - Week 11 (Tuesday 3/31 & Thursday 4/2) - will be on 430 Discord channel during regularly scheduled classtime

## III. Homework​Assignments​ 
 - will remain mostly unchanged other than that they have been pushed back to account for the missing week of classes
 - much of the optional content of the course has been pruned so that you can focus on the final project
 - I do understand that with 2 weeks off, some of you might be feeling a little "rusty", so I created two very simple HW assignments that are due soon (Mongo HW & Handlebars HW, both with accompanying videos - see the Assignments section of myCourses):
   - these are designed as a "reality check" on your current ability (based on these unforeseen circumstances) to do work remotely for this course
   - recall that under the course rubric, homework is 50% of your final 430 grade, and the completion of HW assignments is also essential to your preparation for the final project
   - if you are unable to complete these 2 assignments in a timely manner, you must immediately contact me to discuss your options regarding continuing in this course
 
## IV. The Final Project
- Project 2 and 3​ will now be combined into a single, larger project Given the time constraints we now face, it is unreasonable to ask everyone to do two complete projects. 
- Instead, you will complete one that is slightly larger than either of the two. This project will be worth 40% of your grade (Project 2 was worth 15% and Project 3 was worth 25%), and a portion of that grade will be your completion of the "Milestone"
- Project details are listed on the course website:
  - https://people.rit.edu/arwigm/430/​You will be expected to create a Product/Service using MVC and React
  - I am no longer allowing groups for this project

## V. Questions & Concerns
- What else do I need to address?
